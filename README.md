# ISO-Container-Photo-Rear-End
## Container here is a term related to transportation

This project will include several photos of the CONTAINER REAR END(also called DOOR END).  
 ![image](https://github.com/zrazerx/ISO-Container-Photo-Rear-End/blob/main/example/example.png)
I have blurred the owner code in the photo. If you want to verify the check digit of the container number, you can contact me to get the weight sum of the first four digits.  
  
These photos have been labelled using labelimg, but I can't make them public at this time.  
In the future, i wanna complete the identification algorithm of container number\damage detection.  

PLEASE NOTE THAT these photos are taken by different cameras/mobile phones.   
At the same time, I compressed these photos in advance, some maybe really poor.
